      <h2>Art Marketplace Mobile App</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="indented-line">
            I developed a mobile application designed to connect independent artists with potential buyers around the world. The app allows artists to showcase their work, manage their own profiles, and sell their creations without relying on traditional galleries or intermediaries. It emphasizes freedom, visibility, and simplicity—offering both artists and art lovers a modern, elegant experience tailored to the mobile age.
        </span>
        <br><br>
        <span class="indented-line">
            Whether you're an emerging painter or a digital illustrator, the platform makes it easy to publish, promote, and profit from your art. Buyers, on the other hand, can browse personalized feeds, follow their favorite artists, and purchase directly through the app. This project was inspired by the idea of empowering creativity through technology and decentralizing the art market.

      <p>
        <strong>Technologies & Languages Used:</strong><br><br>
        • <strong>React Native (TypeScript)</strong> – Used as the core framework to build a performant and consistent mobile experience for both iOS and Android users using a single codebase.<br>
        • <strong>JavaScript</strong> – Utilized alongside TypeScript for utility functions, dynamic components, and certain library integrations.<br>
        • <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> – Implemented for secure sign-up/login functionality, supporting both email/password and third-party providers like Google or Apple.<br>
        • <strong>Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)</strong> – Chosen as the real-time database to store dynamic data such as user profiles, artwork listings, and chat messages between buyers and artists.<br>
        • <strong>Firebase Cloud Storage</strong> – Used to upload and serve high-resolution artwork images quickly and reliably.<br>
        • <strong>Expo</strong> – Leveraged for rapid development, over-the-air updates, and simplified build processes.<br>
        • <strong>Figma</strong> – Utilized for designing clean and user-friendly UI/UX mockups before development began.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        <strong>Future Plans:</strong><br><br>
        • Add social features such as liking, commenting, and following other artists to increase engagement.<br>
        • Implement AI-powered artwork recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.<br>
        • Build a web dashboard for artists to manage their shops more comfortably from a browser.<br>
        • Integrate <strong>Stripe API</strong> to handle secure and scalable in-app payments.<br>
        • Improve accessibility and localization to reach broader audiences globally.
